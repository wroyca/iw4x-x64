  // A small wrapper around `CommandLineToArgvW()` for accessing arguments on
  // Windows outside of `main()`.
  //
  // Unlike on POSIX, Windows provides no stable `argv` array: each call to
  // `CommandLineToArgvW()` yields a fresh buffer that must be freed with
  // `LocalFree()`. This puts us in the business of tracking allocations we
  // never asked for, which is both easy to get wrong and awkwardly at odds with
  // the usual C++ ownership model.
  //
  // A second complication is that the Windows API stores arguments in UTF-16.
  // While defensible in principle, in practice the surrounding C++ code almost
  // always assumes UTF-8. Rather than force every call site to scatter ad-hoc
  // conversions, we centralize the matter here and present a UTF-8 faÃ§ade.
  //
  // In short, this type makes two policy decisions:
  //
  //   1. Own the `CommandLineToArgvW()` buffer with proper RAII semantics, so
  //      resource management follows C++ expectations rather than Windows
  //      footnotes.
  //
  //   2. Perform UTF-16 -> UTF-8 conversion at the point of access, so callers
  //      operate in the more idiomatic encoding without incidental boilerplate.
  //
  // TODO: Replace with https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3474R0.html if it ever
  // becomes accepted and/or an implementation is made available (for example,
  // via Boost). At that point this bespoke wrapper should be retired in favour
  // of the standard abstraction.
