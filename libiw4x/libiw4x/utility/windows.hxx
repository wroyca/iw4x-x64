    // A small wrapper around `CommandLineToArgvW()` for accessing arguments on
    // Windows outside of `main()`.
    //
    // Unlike on POSIX, Windows provides no stable `argv` array: each call to
    // `CommandLineToArgvW()` yields a fresh buffer that must be freed with
    // `LocalFree()`. This puts us in the business of tracking allocations we
    // never asked for, which is both easy to get wrong and awkwardly at odds
    // with the usual C++ ownership model.
    //
    // A second complication is that the Windows API stores arguments in UTF-16.
    // While defensible in principle, in practice the surrounding C++ code
    // almost always assumes UTF-8. Rather than force every call site to scatter
    // ad-hoc conversions, we centralize the matter here and present a UTF-8
    // faÃ§ade.
    //
    // In short, this type makes two policy decisions:
    //
    //   1. Own the `CommandLineToArgvW()` buffer with proper RAII semantics, so
    //      resource management follows C++ expectations rather than Windows
    //      footnotes.
    //
    //   2. Perform UTF-16 -> UTF-8 conversion at the point of access, so
    //   callers
    //      operate in the more idiomatic encoding without incidental
    //      boilerplate.
    //
    // TODO: Replace with https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3474R0.html if it
    // ever becomes accepted and/or an implementation is made available (for
    // example, via Boost). At that point this bespoke wrapper should be retired
    // in favour of the standard abstraction.
